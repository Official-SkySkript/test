### Typo Fixing

**Checklist**

**Page link**
<!-- Link the page this error is on. If you can, get a "direct" link to the exact section in the paragraph.-->


**Describe the type**
<!-- Whats wrong with it? Is it bad grammer or simply a misspelling? Please keep in mind if an article seems to be written in amarican english, try and keep it that way. The same goes for other "types" of english as well.-->

**Screenshots**
<!-- If you have none, thats fine. If you happen to be able to take a screenshot underlying the issue, that would greatly help with bug fixing -->
