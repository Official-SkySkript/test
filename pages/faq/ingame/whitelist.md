## How to add players to the whitelist

<Hint severity="warning">
If you are not opped, use your Minehut dashboard to execute these commands.
</Hint>

First, use `/whitelist add <playername>` to add yourself to the whitelist. for bedrock players, use `/whitelist add *<playername>`. Opped players can bypass the whitelist, so make sure to deop anyone you don't want bypassing the whitelist.

Then, enable the whitelist useing `/whitelist on`. When you want to disable it, use `/whitelist off`.
