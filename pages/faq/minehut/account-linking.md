# Linking

## OVERVIEW

Some features on Minehut require your account to be linked, for example voting and creating a server.

## HOW TO LINK YOUR ACCOUNT

1. Go to your `Account Settings` which can be found [here](https://minehut.com/profile).
2. Scroll down and click the button that says `Link Account`. You should receive a command that you can copy to your clipboard.
3. Join the **Minehut lobby** _\(`minehut.com`\)_ and paste in the command it gave you, and your account will be linked!
