# Cracked Minecraft

Cracked Minecraft is a version of Minecraft which you haven't paid for, Minehut does not support this. Some launchers like Tlauncher and HackPhoenix suppost this feature, although I actually reccommend using Tlauncher on a day-to-day basis as it comes preinstalled with vannilla, optifine, ristis, and has a built in mod menu. In order to play Minehut you must buy an account at [Minecraft's website](https://minecraft.net). Minehut has **no plans** to support cracked in the future.
