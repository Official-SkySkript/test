# Joining

## OVERVIEW

This tutorial will explain how to join the Minehut network as a hole, and how to join your own Minehut server.

## HOW TO JOIN

### METHOD 1 - INDIRECTLY

1. Connect to the Minehut lobby _\(Java: `minehut.com`, Bedrock: `bedrock.minehut.com`\)_.
2. Connect to your own server by doing `/join (server name)`.

<Hint severity="info">
Note, when joining indirectly, do not include <inlineCode>.minehut.gg</inlineCode> in the <inlineCode>/join</inlineCode> command.
</Hint>

### METHOD 2 - DIRECTLY

You can connect to a Minehut server by entering the server IP on your servers list, every Minehut server has the same IP address, `(server name).minehut.gg`.

<Hint severity="info">
Note, when joining directly, if the server is not online or you've typed in the server name wrong, you'll be brought to the main Minehut lobby.
