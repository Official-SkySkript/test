# Default Gamemode

## OVERVIEW

Hello there, today I will teach you how to set your default gamemode on your Minehut server.

## HOW TO DO

First, you need to login to your [panel](https://minehut.com/dashboard/home) and start up your server, when your server is started, go to the **"Settings"** tab and find **"Gamemode"**, you'll have four options **"Adventure"**, **"Creative"**, **"Survival"**, and **"Spectator"**, now click on the gamemode you want your players to be in when they join and click on **"Save"** and now restart your server for your changes to take effect and now your player will join your server in the gamemode you selected and that's how you set the default gamemode on your Minehut server.
