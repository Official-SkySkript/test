# Logs

## OVERVIEW

Logs are what they sound like, they log everything that happens on your server. Your logs are especially useful when looking for errors, and if your server has stopped working.

## HOW TO RETRIEVE YOUR LATEST.LOG

Head over to the **files** section of the web panel. Find the **Logs folder**. From there, **select latest.log** and copy all of that!

## USING PASTEBIN.COM

Logs are best viewed when sent using pastebin.com. Head over to their website and paste in the text you copied from your latest.log. From there, click **Create New Paste**, and send the link it gives you.
