# Recommended Plugins

### Base Plugin

Almost every server, from kitpvp to survival, to skygens, etc, will need this plugin: [**EssentialsX**](/plugins/popular/essentials). This all in one plugin is at the heart of every server and simplifies commands, adds permissions, lets you moniter stats, and more. \(if you want to use normal minecraft commands, add `/minecraft:` before your command\)

### Other great plugins

These are a few plugins I thought would be noteworthy to share when creating a server:

-   [`WorldEdit`](/plugins/popular/worldedit) is an easy-to-use ingame world editor for Minecraft, supporting both single player and multiplayer.
-   [`WorldGuard`](/plugins/popular/worldguard) lets you easily create zones in your world that only permit mods or certain players from building within. You can also set additional game rules on your server \(deny mob spawning, block destroying, falling damage, etc.\).
-   [`CoreProtect`](/plugins/popular/coreprotect) is a fast, efficient, data logging and anti-griefing tool. Rollback and restore any amount of damage.
-   `EssentialsChat` lets you format your chat and makes it look really nice! Watch trent from Minehut to learn more about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU_tK-zYYb4).
-   [`Multiverse`](/plugins/popular/multiverse) is a complete world management solution, with other plugins like Portals or Inventory.
-   [`Skript & addons`](/skript/basics) This is a plugin that allows you to customize Minecraft's mechanics with simple scripts written in plain English sentences. You can easily create complex custom commands, triggers that execute effects under certain conditions, and scripts that just run periodically - all without having to know even the slightest bit about programming! The \(hopefully\) intuitive language has the advantage that you don't even need to learn much to be able to use Skript.
-   `Vault` Dependency for a lot of plugins. Highly recommend you install it.

## SPECIFIC PLUGIN CATGORIES

### PERMISSIONS PLUGINS

There are a lot of permission plugins on Minehut, but only two that I would consider people use: Luckperms and PermissionsEX. These allow you to specify perms for groups or players, so that you don't have to op all your staff.

-   [`LuckPerms`](/plugins/permission-plugins/luckperms) - Easier for beginners, because of the online editor. The ingame commands are also very similar to permissionEX in that sense, but the online editor allows mass rank management and rank creation. Its also nice to see everything visually.
-   [`PermissionsEx`](/plugins/permission-plugins/permissionsex) - is another well known permission plugin. While it doesn't have the fancy online editor, PEX is known for being a nice and simple solution for group management without hassle.

### 1.8 PvP

By far, the best 1.8 PvP plugin is `OldCombatMechanics`. This is the one with less bugs/issues.

### Version Support

The best plugins for multiversion support are `ViaVersion`, `ViaBackwards`, and `ViaRewind`. These are much better than ProtocolSupport for numerous reasons, including lag prevention, block fixing, and less overall bugs. These are also the ones Minehut uses. \(Note that these are 3 plugins, not 1 like ProtocolSupport. If you have to follow the 12 plugin limit, use ProtocolSupport instead\)

## SERVER TYPE PLUGINS

Please note that unlike the other sections, this is primarily based on my opinion.

### SURVIVAL SERVER PLUGINS

Most SMP's don't need many plugins, and can be pretty light-weight compared to minigame servers. But, that isn't to say you don't need any:

-   [`CoreProtect`](/plugins/popular/coreprotect) - A block management tool that lets you rollback griefing, find who placed/broke blocks, and even logs chests!
-   [`WorldEdit`](/plugins/popular/worldedit) - Great for taking down griefed buildings, lag machines, etc.

### PvP Servers

-   `Old Combat Mechanics` - Allows you to switch to the pre-1.9 combat.
-   `Version Support` - Read more about ViaVersion above.
-   `Inventory Rollback` - Roll back player's inventories. Very helpful for pvp servers where people lose an item in progression.
-   `Item Editor` - Allows admins to create items wth over the top enchatments and cool names.

### Minigame Servers

-   `Item Editor` - Allows admins to create items wth over the top enchatments and cool names.
-   `HolographicDisplays` - Create floating text in your server.
